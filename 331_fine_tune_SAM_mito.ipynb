        "\n",
        "* **Flexible prompting:** SAM can be prompted with a variety of input, including points, boxes, and text descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Real-time mask computation:** SAM can generate masks for objects in real time. This makes SAM ideal for applications where it is necessary to segment objects quickly, such as autonomous driving and robotics.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Ambiguity awareness:** SAM is aware of the ambiguity of objects in images. This means that SAM can generate masks for objects even when they are partially occluded or overlapping with other objects.\n",

        "\n",
        "**How does SAM work?**\n",

        "SAM works by first encoding the image into a high-dimensional vector representation. The prompt is encoded into a separate vector representation. The two vector representations are then combined and passed to a mask decoder, which outputs a mask for the object specified by the prompt.\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "The image encoder is a vision transformer (ViT-H) model, which is a large language model that has been pre-trained on a massive dataset of images. The prompt encoder is a simple text encoder that converts the input prompt into a vector representation. The mask decoder is a lightweight transformer model that predicts the object mask from the image and prompt embeddings.\n",
